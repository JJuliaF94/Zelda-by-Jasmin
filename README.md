Hi this is Zelda by Jasmin, a not finished version of it, love it or hate it :)
Thanks so much to this guy, who made it possible for me to create this great game, because of his clear and structured tutorials :)

Documentation of the game (Structure)

1. loaded assets for the game
2. basic setup for a project in Unity
3. created a player and added the movement
4. added animation to the player, to generate a organic (realistic) movement
5. created Scene 1 (the first world of the Zelda Game)
6. added a smooth camera movement
7. added Room Transitions, so that the Player can walk from e.g. Room 1 to Room 2
8. created a sign, including a dialog box
9. added an attack animation to the player, so that he can attack (enemies) with a sword
10. created some pots to destroy them (at the moment this has no deeper meaning, just for fun, destroying pots jeah)
11. created enemy animations (log goes to sleep, log wakes up, when the player is around)
12. created a knockback - if the player hits the log (enemy) he is kind of pushed away
13. created more enemy animations - log follows the player by walking
14. added a heart system
15. added more rooms
16. created a house (at the moment the house has no special benefit, it just looks nice)
17. switching between scenes (from Scene 1 to the house and back)
18. added fading, if the player switches a scene
19. added question marks (in a dialog box)
20. created a tressure chest
21. added another enemy (patrol log - a log that walks from point a to point b until the player is in his area, than he starts to chase him)
22. created another world (scene) - dungeon (the finale battles are there to find)
23. added a key to the tressure chest, with this key you can open the door at the dungeon world (inside it)
24. added an enemy death effect - the enemy dies, the enemy dissolves into fire
25. added hearts to give the player new live - more chances not do die 
26. added coins
27. created a screen kick, to create a good effect, if the enemy hits you 
28. created another enemy (turret enemy) - he likes to kill you with stones - my favourite log
29. created an enemy door - thats where i left..

There are a few bugs left (to much to tell them all but here are a few to tell)
- the camera isnt quite perfect, so you can see the edge of the world sometimes, if have to play better with the x and y coordinates
- there is no start screen, pause screen and game over screen, i will at this later on :)
- if you die, you have to start the game new by pressing cmd + q (mac) 
....

how to play the game:
- press play
- find the treassure chest
- get the key
- find the entry for the dungeon world (a hole in a rock)
- open the door
- find the right switches to open the battle fields
- try not do die
- if you manage to defeat all enemies you are the president 
  because that is impossible without the weapon which has not yet been implemented xD
